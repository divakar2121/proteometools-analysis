#  My Proteomics Analysis Journey

Welcome to my proteomics analysis project. I'm learning computational proteomics and wanted to share my journey analyzing mass spectrometry data.

##  What is this project about?

I analyzed protein data from mass spectrometry experiments to understand:
- How different methods work for identifying proteins
- Which techniques give the best results
- How to ensure data quality in proteomics experiments

##  What I discovered

###  My Results:
- Analyzed **265,451 spectra** (individual measurements from the machine)
- Found **5,943 peptides** (small protein pieces)
- Identified **74 complete proteins** 
- Compared **3 different analysis methods**

### Which method worked best?
| Method Name | How Good? | How Efficient? | Best For |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **3xHCD** | 60/100 | Needs 52 measurements per peptide | Finding new proteins |
| **ETD** | 49/100  | Needs only 33 measurements per peptide | Quick, targeted analysis |

##  What tools did I use?

- **Python** : Programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook** : Interactive workspace
- **ThermoRawFileParser** : Converts raw machine data
- **MaxQuant** : Identifies proteins from data

## What's in this project?

##  Key Analysis Files:
- **protein_analysis.ipynb**: Complete workflow from raw data to results
- **maxquant_analysis_summary.csv**: 14 datasets with peptide/protein counts
- **comprehensive_qc_analysis.csv**: Quality metrics for 265,451 spectra
- **final_integrated_analysis.csv**: Method comparison (3xHCD vs ETD)
- **protein_database_matches.csv**: 74 proteins validated against human database

###  What's NOT included (due to size):
- Raw mass spectrometry files (*.raw) 
- Converted mzML files (*.mzML.gz) 
- MaxQuant processed files (*.zip)
